    <h1>Some of my favourite sites</h1>
    <h2>Manganato</h2>
    <p>
      One of my favourite websites is called
      <a href="https://manganato.com/">Manganato.</a>
      This site allows ordinary users to read mangas for free.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Animepahe</h2>
    <p>
      You can watch or download animes for free at
      <a href="https://animepahe.com/">Animepahe</a>
      This site has good video compression algorithm.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Just Light Novel</h2>
    <p>
      My first site where I downloaded Light Novels from.
      <a href="https://www.justlightnovels.com/">Just Light Novel</a>
      is a good
      website to download LN but it's redirection to other websites is a 
      little annoying. I also use 
      <a href="https://jnovels.com/">JNovels</a>
      to download LN in pdf form.
