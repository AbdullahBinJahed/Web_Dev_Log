    <h1>Float Demo</h1>
    <p>
      Paragraph 1.
      This paragraph has the normal behaviour of a block-level element.
      It takes up the entire width of the page, and the next element
      is placed underneath.
    </p>
    <p class="floated">
      Paragraph 2.
      This paragraph is floated left. It is placed to the left, and the
      next element will be placed to the right of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paragraph 3.
      This paragraph has no floating, width or margin. It takes whatever
      space it can to the right of the floated element, and then flows
      to the next line.
    </p>
