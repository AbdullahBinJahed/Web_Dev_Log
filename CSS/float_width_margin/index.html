    <h1>Specifying the width</h1>
    <p>
      Paragraph 1.
      This paragraph has the normal behaviour of a block-level element.
      It takes up the entire width of the page, and the next element
      is placed underneath.
    </p>
    <p class="floated">
      Paragraph 2.
      This paragraph is floated left. The
      next element will be placed to the right of it. Now this has a width
      of 50%.
    </p>
    <p class="right">
      Paragraph 3.
      This paragraph now has a margin-left so it is separated from the
      previous paragraph. It's width is still automatically
      determined.
